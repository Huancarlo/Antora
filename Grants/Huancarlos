Good afternoon team. I have always maintained a node of various projects in the testnet, now for the first time I want to try it in the mainnet.
Previously installed nodes in such projects as Subspace, Aleo, Ironfish, Nim, Assettantle and many others.
I've been with IDEP since the very beginning, participating in both testnets.

At the moment, I launched the node in the mainnet and the synchronization was completed. I will be glad if you provide coins to run the validator.
